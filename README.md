##### About me
Greetings! My name is Aries Chen, and I am currently pursuing my graduate studies in the fascinating field of geophysics at the prestigious China University of Petroleum.

Outside of my academic endeavors, I am an avid reader with a voracious appetite for a wide range of literature, and I take great pleasure in challenging my physical endurance by participating in marathon races.
